# Recap Project 6: Tourio App

This coding-challenge was part of the "neuefische" web-development bootcamp.

In this project we build a Tourio App, the best friend of all travelers: it displays sights you want to visit and lets you edit them.

Database @ Mongo-Atlas - Deployment @ Vercel

## Development

### Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to create a production build
- `npm run start` to start the production build
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
